Links in Kali Linux:-
----------------------
A link in linux is a pointer to a file. Like pointers in any programming languages, links in linux are pointers pointing to a file or a directory. 

There are two types of links :

    Hard Links
    Soft Link or Symbolic links

    For example, if we have a file a.txt. If we create a hard link to the file and then delete the file, we can still access the file using hard link. But if we create a soft link of the file and then delete the file, we canâ€™t access the file through soft link 

    Hard Links -  ln  [original filename] [link name] 
    Symbolic Links - ln  -s [original filename] [link name]
